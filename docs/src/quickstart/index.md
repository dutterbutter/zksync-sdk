# Quickstart

The Quickstart guides help you get your first ZKsync deposit action running in minutes.  
Youâ€™ll learn how to install the SDK, connect a client, and perform a deposit.

## Choose your adapter

This SDK extends existing Ethereum libraries. Pick the Quickstart that matches your stack:

- [Quickstart (viem)](viem.md) â€” for projects already using **viem**.
- [Quickstart (ethers)](ethers.md) â€” for projects using **ethers v6**.

## What youâ€™ll do

Each Quickstart walks you through:

1. **Install** the adapter package.
2. **Configure** a client or signer.
3. **Run** a deposit (L1 â†’ L2) as a working example.
4. **Track** the status until itâ€™s complete.

ðŸ‘‰ Once youâ€™re set up, continue to the [How-to Guides](../guides/index.md) for more detailed usage.

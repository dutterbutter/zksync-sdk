# Choosing Your Adapter: `viem` vs. `ethers`

The SDK is designed to work with both `viem` and `ethers.js`, the two most popular Ethereum libraries. Since the SDK offers **identical functionality** for both, the choice comes down to your project's needs and your personal preference.

## The Short Answer (TL;DR)

- **If you're adding the SDK to an existing project:** Use the adapter for the library you're already using.
- **If you're starting a new project:** The choice is yours. `viem` is generally recommended for new projects due to its modern design, smaller bundle size, and excellent TypeScript support.

You can't make a wrong choice. Both adapters are fully supported and provide the same features.

## What you’ll do

Each Quickstart walks you through how to:

1. **Install** the adapter package.
2. **Configure** a client or signer.
3. **Run** a deposit (L1 → L2) or withdrawal (L2 → L1) as a working example.
4. **Track** the status until it’s complete.

description: Learn what the `@zksync-sdk` is and how it simplifies ZKsync cross-chain flows for viem and ethers.

# Introduction

The **`@zksync-sdk`** is a lightweight extension for [`viem`](https://viem.sh) and [`ethers`](https://docs.ethers.io/) that makes ZKsync cross-chain actions simple and consistent.

Instead of re-implementing accounts or low-level RPC logic, this SDK focuses only on **ZKsync-specific flows**:

- Deposits (L1 â†’ L2)
- Withdrawals (L2 â†’ L1, including finalization)
- Try variants for functional error handling (e.g. )
- Status & wait helpers
- ZKsync-specific JSON-RPC methods

<Info>
The SDK doesnâ€™t replace your existing Ethereum libraries â€” it **extends** them with ZKsync-only capabilities while keeping your current tooling intact.

### Key Supported Features

- **Deposits (L1 â†’ L2)** â€” ETH, Custom Base Token and ERC-20  
  - **Initiate on L1:** build and send the deposit transaction from Ethereum.  
  - **Track progress:** query intermediate states (queued, included, executed).  
  - **Verify completion on L2:** confirm funds credited/available on ZKsync.

- **Withdrawals (L2 â†’ L1)** â€” ETH, Custom Base Token and ERC-20  
  - **Initiate on L2:** create the withdrawal transaction on ZKsync.  
  - **Track progress:** monitor execution and finalization availability.  
  - **Finalize on L1:** finalize withdrawal to release funds back to Ethereum.

- **ZKsync RPC**  
  - **`getBridgehubAddress`** (`zks_getBridgehubContract`) â€“ resolve the canonical Bridgehub contract address.  
  - **`getL2ToL1LogProof`** (`zks_getL2ToL1LogProof`) â€“ retrieve the log proof for an L2 â†’ L1 transaction.  
  - **`getReceiptWithL2ToL1`** *(receipt extension)* â€“ returns a standard Ethereum `TransactionReceipt` **augmented** with `l2ToL1Logs`.
